# wrongthink

### THIS SOFTWARE IS VULNERABLE TO KCI AND SHOULD NOT BE USED WITHOUT PROPER PRECAUTIONS UNTIL THE REMOVAL OF THIS NOTICE.

wrongthink chat v2:
* is peer-to-peer
* has end-to-end encryption (Double Ratchet over DTLS (WebRTC))
* supports Markdown
* has notifications using MaterializeCSS
* is verifiable

### IMPORTANT: no warranty is provided with this software. you are using it at your own risk. please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more info
### ALSO IMPORTANT: wrongthink.me must use certain data in order for the service to run properly. please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more info

## use
* [bleeding edge](https://birb.digital/wrongthink)
* [stable](https://wrongthink.me)

the bleeding edge version is based off the latest commit made, while the stable version is the last tested version. the stable version may receive updates later than the bleeding edge version, but the stable version is guaranteed to work.

## credits
wrongthink.me would not be possible without the following libraries:
* [TweetNaCl.js (cryptography)](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js) and [its](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-util-js) [addons](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-auth-js)
* [double-ratchet (cryptography, made in house!)](https://github.com/birb-digital/double-ratchet)
* [DOMPurify (security)](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)
* [MaterializeCSS (UI)](https://github.com/materializecss/materialize)

## how are things derived
### fingerprint
the fingerprint used for connection is derived from the SHA-512 hash of the public key. the fingerprint is converted into 8 words (with a word list of 256 words), allowing for 2^64 combinations. this makes it somewhat suitable for identity verification but **it is not recommended unless security is not a concern**.
### safety number
the safety number is derived from `SHA512(xPublic + yPublic)`, where both keys are the identity keys of the peers. the hash is converted to 16 words (with a word list of 256 words), allowing for 128 bits of security. the order of the fingerprints is determined by the first byte of the public identity keys.
### file uploading
file uploading uses an extension to the double ratchet library we use. the steps are as follows:
- take `encrypt(Base64(our random 32-byte file key))`
- set the resulting object's `hasFile` property to true
- set the resulting object's `file` property to a new object containing:
  - the property `encrypted`: `Base64(raw_encrypt(file, our random 32-byte file key, nonce))`
  - the property `nonce`: `Base64(our random 32-byte nonce)`

## custom clients
custom clients are as easy as 1, 2, 3. just use PeerJS and use https://wrongthink.me:8080 as the PeerJS server. from there, you'll need to use [parabirb/double-ratchet](https://github.com/parabirb/double-ratchet) to handshake and send messages.

## running it
just open `index.html` in the browser of your choice.

## terminology
* arachat is the name of the wrongthink client
* wrongthink2 is the messaging protocol
* wrongthink is the name of the service

## misc
`v2.0.html` is the old version of wrongthink2 which used OTRv3. it is now obsolete (NOT compatible with any new clients) and kept only for educational purposes. `v1.html` is the old version of wrongthink which was not E2EE. it is still usable with server `wss://wrongthink.me:9764` but not recommended. it is also kept only for educational purposes.
